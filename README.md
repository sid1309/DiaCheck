# DiaCheck

**Diabetes Prediction Model**

DiaCheck is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on key health metrics. It leverages a comprehensive dataset and advanced preprocessing techniques to deliver accurate predictions, assisting users in understanding their risk factors.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Accurately predicts diabetes risk using health indicators like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and age.
- **High Model Performance**:
  - Achieved **78% accuracy** on training data.
  - Achieved **76% accuracy** on test data.
- **Feature Selection and Normalization**: Ensures the model focuses on the most relevant factors for reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive workflow for users to input data and receive results.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data normalization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For model implementation, training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for high-performing predictions.


## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset that includes multiple health indicators related to diabetes, such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age

Data preprocessing involved cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to improve accuracy and performance.
